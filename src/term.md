| Wayland                        | Wayland is a new generation protocol to replace X Window System to overcome its shortcomings and start from scratch to get rid of the legacy architecture burdens. It still follows the server-client model of X, but drops the network |
| Window Manager                 | "A window manager (WM) is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface (GUI). It can be part of a desktop environment (DE) or be used standalone." - Arch wiki. The concept is unique to X because for Wayland the compositor also takes control of the appearance of the GUI. |
| X.Org                          | In 1999 the Open Group formed X.Org and it supervised X11R6.5.1 onward, while development mostly happened in XFree86 project.

| X11                            | X Window System version 11. Since X reached version 11 in 3 years and this major version number never changed, X11 is often used exchangeable for X Window System. |
| Xe                             | Intel Xe, brand name for Intel GPU architecture, replaces the previous internal used "Gen" plus generation number code name for integrated GPU architecture.

| Xe driver                      | Intel's new Linux GPU driver to better support recent GPUs since the Xe architecture.

| X Window System                | The mostly used windowing system protocol for UNIX-like systems. It's a protocol that defines how the X server and X clients communicate with each other to get user input events to X clients and get X clients graphics output together to the X server to finally output to the display device. It's often called as X11, Xorg or simply X. |
